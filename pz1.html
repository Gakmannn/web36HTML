  Vehicle
  
  A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum[1]) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles,
  motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats),
  amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.[2]
  
  Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled,
  tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles
  types, terms and definitions.[3]
